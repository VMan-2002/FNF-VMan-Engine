# Friday Night Funkin - VMan Engine

Use the latest version of Polymod `haxelib update polymod`

For mod makers: If you want new features in official vman engine, just make an [issue](https://github.com/VMan-2002/FNF-VMan-Engine/issues) (make sure you're on the latest release!) or a [pull request](https://github.com/VMan-2002/FNF-VMan-Engine/pulls)

Please dont steal code that you don't own or dont have permission for..... ? i guess. if you're unsure, add credits to the code you've taken

If there is a security issue, let me know privately

If you make a mod and distribute a modified / recompiled version of this engine, you must open source your mod as well [(well FNF already requires that anyway...)](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin/blob/master/README.md)

## the rest of the README.md is the same, but it's changed so that you compile this correctly

This is the repository for Friday Night Funkin, a game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop".

## Build instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR COMPILING THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE!!!

IF YOU WANT TO JUST DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL AND PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY, GO TO [releases](https://github.com/VMan-2002/FNF-VMan-Engine/releases)

IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE THE GAME YOURSELF, CONTINUE READING!!!

### Installing the Required Programs

First, you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need are the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
polymod
hxcpp-debugger
json2object
extension-networking
linc_luajit
```
So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install polymod`

Make sure you have the version 1.5.2 of Polymod `haxelib install polymod 1.5.2`

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.

You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed-out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

### Compiling game
NOTE: If you see any messages relating to deprecated packages, ignore them. They're just warnings that don't affect compiling

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run `lime test html5 -debug` in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480 )
To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug` and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
