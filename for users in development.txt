currently there's no mods menu!!!

so edit modsActive.txt

the format is:
A:B
where A is whether it's enabled (1 or 0), and B is the mod folder name

also the order of mods matters as well! higher mods will take priority for stuff such as menus

to reload without restarting the game, return to title screen
