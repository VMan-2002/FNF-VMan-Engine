== translation documentation ==

[strings.txt]
	This file is used for most translatable strings in the game.
	A translatable string is defined in this file like this:

	<context>_<key>::<text>

	<context>: The context of the string, example: "playstate" or "optionsMenu"
	<key>: Reference for the text. Must be lowercase.
	<text>: The resulting translated text. Can contain inputs such as "#0" for the game's code to input other text in certain situations.

	Lines that are blank or that start with "//" are skipped over and can be used as comments.
	Lines that contain but don't start with "//" however, are not treated as having comments.
	To write a comment about a specific line, you must write it on a different line.

[rankwords/default.txt]
	This file is used for rank words.
	They can be seen in the in-game HUD via the "rankWord" item in "Customize HUD" in options.
	Each line looks like this:

	<threshold>::<text>

	<threshold>: accRating must be equal to or above this value to show this line.
	<text>: The text shown when accRating meets the threshold.

	Thresholds must be in ascending order in order to work correctly.
	The first, seconds and last rank words in the file are given special treatment.
	The first rank word is used when the player hasn't hit any notes yet.
	The second rank word is used when accRating doesn't meet any threshold.
	The last rank word is used when the player has MFC; they only hit "Marvelous" rating.

[Dialogue]
	[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
	Dialogue can be translated using files at the following location:

	<mod>/dialogue/<song>-<dialogue>.json

	<mod>: Matches the name of the folder containing the entire mod.
	<song>: Matches the name of the folder containing the song data.
	<dialogue>: Matches the name of the original dialogue file.

	When a translated dialogue file exists, the game uses it instead of the original file.
