A lot of changes are in this update but here's some highlights

Note hit judgements are now based on music time, which is more consistent
Input offset option is now implemented
You can now press Reset key to clear a control, or to reset Input Offset value
You can now press and hold left/right to move the input offset ms faster instead of just pressing many times
Known issue: You can't hit notes in Offset Calibrate. Idk how to fix can we get a more knowledgable programmer on this
Friday Night Funkin weeks now actually show up
Added documentation link to the Tools menu (which is accessable by pressing 7 in the main menu)
Also updated the documentation
Fixed meta txt files for music
Implemented more note type attributes (also added "No Animation" note type)
Additional stuff (check the documentation!)
Let me know if anything shown on the documentation doesn't work
